# Kolmogorov-axioms-and-Normal-distribution-in-R
Around 1900 the axiomatic approach to mathematics had spread well beyondclassical setting of Euclidean geometry, and the particular question of how to ax-
iomatize Probability was highlighted as part of Hilbert’s sixth problem:
Mathematical Treatment of the Axioms of Physics. The investigations on the
foundations of geometry suggest the problem: To treat in the same manner,means of axioms, those physical sciences in which already today mathematics plays
an important part; in the first rank are the theory of probabilities and mechanics.
While Probability certainly involves some conceptually extra idea (relative to the
rest of Mathematics), the issue was whether Probability required some new technical
ingredient to be added to the rest of Mathematics. Kolmogorov’s achievement was
the realization that it didn’t. Measure theory had been recently developed to resolve
the technical conflict between the intuitive idea "every region in the plane has some
area" and the axioms of set theory dealing with every subset of an uncountable set.
This conflict has no conceptual connection with Probability, but Kolmogorov real-
ized that the technical machinery (involved in its resolution) of measures, measur-
able sets, measurable functions could be reused as an axiomatic setting for Proba-
bility. In retrospect, because one special model within Probability is "pick a uniform
random point from the unit square", it is clear that any general theory of Probability
has to include measure theory, but (to reiterate) Kolmogorov’s achievement was the
realization that at the technical level it didn’t require anything more.
With agreed axioms, mathematicians happily moved on with systematic devel-
opment of theorem-proof Probability. The firm connection to the rest of theorem-
proof Mathematics enabled researchers to use tools from other fields of Mathemat-
ics, particularly in the context of limit theorems. More prosaically, it is helpfulhave coherent notation covering both discrete and continuous probability distribu-
tions and random variables.
